NAME
       NGLister - Tool to download newsgroup information from news servers

SYNOPSIS
       nglister [ -u username ] [ -p password ] [ -P port ] hostname filename


       nglister -h | --help


DESCRIPTION
       NGLister  is  a  tool  to  download  information about groups and other
       information available on an NNTP (Usenet news) server.  It is  designed
       to  be fast and simple; just specify the server and the information you
       want, and NGLister will send it to standard output.

       You can write the information to a file by appending:

       > filename

       to the end of your command-line.

       NGLister requires only one piece of optional software: Optik.  You  can
       find it at
        <URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/optik/Optik-1.3.tar.gz>.

OPTIONS
       -u username
              Specifies the user name to use for logging into the server.  Use
              this only if your server requires authentication.

       -p password
              Specifies the password to use for logging into the server.   Use
              this only if your server requires a password.

       -P port
              Specifies the numeric port to use when connecting.  Most servers
              listen on port 119, the default NNTP port, so that value is used
              by the default.  This option will only be needed rarely.

       hostname
              Specifies the name of the NNTP server.

       filename
              Specifies  the name of the data to retrieve from the remote NNTP
              server.  Most people will use active or  newsgroups  here.   The
              set  of  files  supported  varies  from  one server to the next.
              Please note that this parameter does not denote an output  file-
              name  or  even a real filename; just the type of information you
              want from the server.  Here  is  a  list  of  commonly-supported
              information  types.   Additional  items are specified in RFC2980
              <URL:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt> with the LIST command.

              o active lists all newsgroups and describes their numbering.

              o newsgroups  lists  the newsgroup descriptions.  Note that most
                servers do not carry descriptions  for  all  groups,  and  the
                groups that lack a description will not be listed here at all.

              o active.times describes how recently each  newsgroup  has  seen
                activity.

              o motd  shows the server's "Message Of The Day" -- that is, cur-
                rent news about the server.

       -h

       --help Displays brief usage help.
