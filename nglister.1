.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBNGLister\fR is a tool to download information about
groups and other information available on an NNTP (Usenet
news) server.  It is designed to be fast and simple;
just specify the server and the information you want,
and \fBNGLister\fR will send it to standard output.
.PP
You can write the information to a file by appending:
.PP
\fB> \fIfilename\fB\fR
.PP
to the end of your command-line.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
To install \fBNGLister\fR, you will need a current version of
Python <URL:http://www.python.org/>.
\fBNGLister\fR requires only one other piece of software:
Optik.  You can find it at
 <URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/optik/Optik-1.3.tar.gz>.
.PP
To install, run this command as root: \fBpython setup.py install\fR
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-u \fIusername\fB\fR
Specifies the user name to use for logging into
the server.  Use this only if your server requires authentication.
.TP
\fB-p \fIpassword\fB\fR
Specifies the password to use for logging into
the server.  Use this only if your server requires a password.
.TP
\fB-P \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the numeric port to use when connecting.
Most servers listen on port 119, the default NNTP port,
so that value is used by the default.  This option will
only be needed rarely.
.TP
\fB\fIhostname\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the NNTP server.
.TP
\fB\fIfilename\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the data to retrieve
from the remote NNTP server.  Most people will use
\fIactive\fR or
\fInewsgroups\fR here.  The set of files
supported varies from one server to the next.  Please
note that this parameter does \fBnot\fR
denote an output filename or even a real filename; just
the type of information you want from the server.
Here is a list of commonly-supported information types.
Additional items are specified in
RFC2980 <URL:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt>
with the LIST command.
